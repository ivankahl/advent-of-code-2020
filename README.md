# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains all my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges - all written in C# (and .NET 5!).

## Project Structure

Each day's challenge is a separate console application. Part One and Two of each day are usually implemented as different methods in the same application.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run any of these solutions for yourself, make sure to first install .NET 5 and then you can clone this repository and build the projects.

## Questions/Issues

If you have any questions about any of these solutions or find any issues, please let me know in the [Issues](https://github.com/ivankahl/advent-of-code-2020/issues) tab.
